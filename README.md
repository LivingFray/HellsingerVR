# HellsingerVR
A VR Mod for Metal: Hellsinger

Made possible by "borrowing", and slightly modifying, DSprtn's modified SteamVR plugin: https://github.com/DSprtn/SteamVR_Standalone_IL2CPP

# Current progress
6DOF 3D rendering in steamvr - DONE

Menus - DONE (no laser pointer, uses left controller joystick + either trigger)

Shooting - MOSTLY DONE (sword might be broken, angle is offset depending on head)

HUD - PARTIALLY DONE (Health, Ultimate, Fury, Rhythm indicators done. Rest needs properly moving to world space)

Slaughter - DONE

Reloading - DONE (bound to a key press, the game is too fast paced for proper vr reloading + its a lot of work)

Weapon switching - DONE

Viewmodels - MOSTLY DONE (Offsets are wonky, some effects are placed incorrectly)

View mirroring - PARTIALLY DONE (Works in menus + in game, but not in cutscenes)
